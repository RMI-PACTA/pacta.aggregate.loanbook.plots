</h3>
<p>The company alignment metric described below is intended to help make
sense of alignment patterns in large analyses, e.g. in the case of a
supervisory analysis of the banking system, where many loan books are
compared. In such situations, high level results are helpful in
highlighting the most important patterns that warrant an in-depth
analysis of the more granular standard PACTA metrics.</p>
<p>Identifying such patterns means that we need to reduce the
information to a more manageable quantity. While this inevitably leads
to a loss of granularity, this is justifiable for summarizing main
findings, as long as the outcomes are consistent with the main PACTA
metrics.</p>
<p>We choose an approach that first aggregates company alignment to a
relative metric at the company/sector level for each of the PACTA
sectors the company operates in. A methodology to calculating this
metric is provided both for the market share approach and the sectoral
decarbonization approach.</p>

</h3>
<p>In this section, we derive the company alignment metric
mathematically and provide interpretations of the relevant pieces. While
in practice, this metric will most often be calculate at time <span class="math inline">\(t = 5\)</span>, it can be calculated for any point
in time, which is why we generalise.</p>
<p>For companies operating in sectors where clear technology transitions
should take place, certain technologies need to be built out (<span class="math inline">\(BO\)</span>) whilst others need to be phased out
(<span class="math inline">\(PO\)</span>). We define the direction <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> of technology <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in sector <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ d_{a,b} =
  \begin{cases}
    BO       &amp; \quad \text{if } a \text{ is a low-carbon
technology}\\
    PO  &amp; \quad \text{if } a \text{ is a high-carbon technology}
  \end{cases},
\]</span></p>
<p>where low-carbon technology and high-carbon technology are mutually
exclusive categories.</p>
<p>The forward-looking production plan <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of company <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> for technology <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in sector <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p_{a,b,c,d,t}\]</span></p>
<p>Which means that at the sector level, we get a <em>net</em>
production plan of:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p_{b,c,t} = \sum_{\forall a \in b}
p_{a,b,c,d,t}\]</span> Correspondingly, the scenario-based production
value <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> of company <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> for technology <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in sector <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[s_{a,b,c,d,t}\]</span></p>
<p>and at the sector level, we therefore get a <em>net</em>
scenario-based production value of:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[s_{b,c,t} = \sum_{\forall a \in b}
s_{a,b,c,d,t}\]</span> We define a directional dummy variable <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> for technology <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, given its direction <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> in sector <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ D_{a,b,d} =
  \begin{cases}
    1       &amp; \quad \text{if } d_{a,b} = BO\\
    -1  &amp; \quad \text{if } d_{a,b} = PO
  \end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>With these definitions, we calculate the total technology deviation
(<span class="math inline">\(\Delta total\)</span>) of company <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> for technology <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in sector <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta total_{a,b,c,d,t} =
(p_{a,b,c,d,t} - s_{a,b,c,d,t}) \times D_{a,b,d}\]</span> Note that the
total technology deviation will be considered aligned when &gt;= 0 and
misaligned when &lt; 0. The Directional dummy ensures this is the case
both for build out and phase out technologies.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="addressing-scenarios-with-bridge-technologies">2.1.1 Addressing scenarios with bridge technologies<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#addressing-scenarios-with-bridge-technologies"></a>
</h4>
<p>In case a technology trajectory in a transition scenario cannot be
clearly classified as a build out or phase out technology over the near
to medium term, we treat such a technology as a bridge technology. More
specifically, this is the case, when the production trajectory for a
technology remains stagnant or the changes vary in direction over a time
frame needed to carry out new investments. Usually, a bridge technology
will be a high-carbon technology that is less emissions intensive than
other high-carbon technologies which need to be phased out first.
Whether or not a technology is considered a bridge technology therefore
depends largely on scenario assumptions and will sometimes differ
between regions even within a scenario.</p>
<p>As a bridge technology is considered high-carbon in principle, but
should not yet be phased out, we need to apply a calculation that
incentivises production planning as close to the scenario-based value as
possible. This ensures that both an overshoot and an undershoot will
lead to deteriorating alignment metrics.</p>
<p>We therefore use a two-sided misalignment logic, which adjusts the
total technology deviation for bridge technology <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta total_{a,b,c,d,t}^{bridge} =
-|p_{a,b,c,d,t} - s_{a,b,c,d,t}|\]</span> Contrary to the standard
formulation of the technology alignment deviation, the technology
deviation for a bridge technology has a maximum at 0, on the basis that
the production forecast exactly meets the scenario-based value at time
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Any deviation from that is
considered misalignment. The remainder of the calculation remains
unchanged.</p>

<p>Based on the total technology deviations calculated above, we can now
derive the net aggregate company alignment metric <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. To derive the net aggregate company
alignment metric, we first define calculate the total deviation of
company <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> for sector <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta total_{b,c,t} = \sum_{\forall a

scenario-based value for company <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>
in sector <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[total_{b,c,t}^{scen} = s_{b,c,t} =
\sum_{\forall a \in b} s_{a,b,c,d,t}\]</span> With these definitions, we

<h4 id="interpretation">Interpretation:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interpretation"></a>
</h4>
<p>The Net Aggregate Company Alignment Metric is a summary of the
alignment of a company in a sector across all relevant technologies
within that sector. It is intended as an overall summary metric that
shows if a company is aligned with a climate scenario on aggregate. As
such, the metric is meant to be a starting point for further analysis.
It can be used as a basis to aggregate alignments of individual
companies in a loan book to get a high level overview of the alignment
in that loan book. It can also be used to further disaggregate the
company alignment metric to obtain more granular insights about its
underlying drivers.</p>
<p>In general, <span class="math inline">\(y_{b,c,t} &gt;= 0\)</span>
means that a company is - on aggregate - aligned with a climate
scenario, whereas <span class="math inline">\(y_{b,c,t} &lt; 0\)</span>
means that it is misaligned. For each of the technologies in the sector
that a company operates in, we measure the directional deviation from
its corresponding scenario-based value at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. A positive value of this deviation
indicates alignment and a negative value indicates misalignment,
regardless of the direction of the technology in the given scenario. The
sum of those deviations across all technologies is then divided by the
company’s sector level scenario value at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. This returns a percent deviation of
the company production from its scenario value at <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(y =
0\)</span> means that there is no deviation, <span class="math inline">\(y = 1\)</span> means that the company is doing one
hundred percent more in terms of buildout and phaseout than it needs to
and <span class="math inline">\(y = -0.5\)</span> means that it is doing
fifty percent less than it needs to according to the scenario values.
Note that this metric does not show exactly where a (mis)alignment comes
from. Hence, following up this analysis on a more granular level is
always a good idea.</p>

<h3 id="build-out-and-phase-out-company-alignment-metric">2.3 Build out and phase out company alignment metric<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#build-out-and-phase-out-company-alignment-metric"></a>
</h3>
<p>One particular strength of the PACTA metrics for sectors with
technology pathways is that it will surface misalignment on the
technology level, which matters particularly in sectors that include
both build out and phase out technologies. Transition scenarios often
assume that particular technologies must be phased out in order to
remain within a carbon budget. Therefore, alignment metrics should not
obscure the need to phase out or build out technologies by simply adding
up bidirectional technology deviations. To account for this, we define a
disaggregation of the net aggregate company alignment metric into its
build out and phase out drivers. While this falls short of the maximum
granularity by design, it ensures that opposite trends in build out and
phase out are not obscured by the analysis.</p>
<p>The disaggregation of the net aggregate company alignment metric into
its <span class="math inline">\(BO\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(PO\)</span> drivers is designed such that the
resulting sum of the disaggregated metrics equals the net metric,
because build out and phase out technologies are mutually exclusive
sets. To calculate the <span class="math inline">\(BO\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(PO\)</span> company alignment metrics, we need to
derive the total deviation of company <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> by technology direction <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> in sector <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta total_{b,c,d,t} = \sum_{\forall a
\in b,d} \Delta total_{a,b,c,d,t}\]</span> The <span class="math inline">\(BO\)</span>(<span class="math inline">\(PO\)</span>) company alignment metric <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> of company <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> by technology direction <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> in sector <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is then defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_{b,c,d,t} = \dfrac{\Delta
total_{b,c,d,t}}{total_{b,c,t}^{scen}}\]</span> Note that the
denominator remains at the net level so that the sum of the
disaggregated metrics is the net metric:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_{b,c,d=BO,t} + y_{b,c,d=PO,t} =
\dfrac{\Delta total_{b,c,d=BO,t} + \Delta
total_{b,c,d=PO,t}}{total_{b,c,t}^{scen}} = \dfrac{\Delta
total_{b,c,t}}{total_{b,c,t}^{scen}} = y_{b,c,t}\]</span> This must be
true because every technology <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>
must have one and only one direction <span class="math inline">\(d \in
\left\{BO,PO\right\}\)</span>.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="interpretation-1">Interpretation:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interpretation-1"></a>
</h4>
<p>Previously, it was mentioned that the aggregated value of <span class="math inline">\(y_{b,c,t}\)</span> does not indicate where the
sources of (mis)alignment can be found. The disaggregation into <span class="math inline">\(BO\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(PO\)</span> drivers of the company aggregate
alignment metric aims to provide a high level overview of just that. In
essence, <span class="math inline">\(y_{b,c,d,t}\)</span> only adds up
the technology deviations for either buildout or phaseout technologies,
while still dividing by the sector level scenario value of the company
(including all technologies). This means that we get a simple
disaggregation of the overall alignment metric into its sum parts.
Hence, it should not be read as an indicator in isolation. However, the
disaggregation can be very helpful in determining if the overall
alignment is driven by a lack of buildout or by slow phaseout.
Additionally, what may look like overall alignment near the target with
<span class="math inline">\(y_{b,c,t}\)</span> close to zero may in
theory be composed of significantly overaligned buildout and
significantly misaligned phaseout or vice versa. This goes to show that,
companies active in sectors with both buidlout and phaseout
technologies, it is important to understand the drivers behind that
overall alignment metric.</p>

sectors<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#net-aggregate-company-alignment-metric-in-emissions-intensity-sectors"></a>
</h3>
<p>For sectors where alignment is calculated using emissions intensity
metrics there is no distinction between build out and phase out
technologies. This means there is only a net aggregate company alignment
metric in emissions intensity sectors <span class="math inline">\(y^*\)</span> and the calculation of that metric is
much more straight forward.</p>
<p>Let emissions intensity based on forward-looking production plan
<span class="math inline">\(p^*\)</span> of company <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> for sector <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p_{b,c,t}^*\]</span> We also define
scenario-based emissions intensity value <span class="math inline">\(s^*\)</span> of company <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> for sector <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[s_{b,c,t}^*\]</span> We then derive the
total emissions intensity deviation (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta
total^*\)</span>) of company <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> in
sector <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta total_{b,c,t}^* = p_{b,c,t}^* -
s_{b,c,t}^*\]</span> It follows that the alignment measure <span class="math inline">\(y^*\)</span> of company <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> based on emissions intensities in
sector <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_{b,c,t}^* = \dfrac{\Delta
total_{b,c,t}^*}{s_{b,c,t}}\]</span></p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="interpretation-2">Interpretation:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interpretation-2"></a>
</h4>
<p>The company alignment metric for emissions intensity sectors <span class="math inline">\(y_{b,c,t}^*\)</span> follows a similar logic as
the one for sectors with technology pathways, in that it measures the
percent deviation of the emissions intensity in time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> for a company from its scenario-based
emissions intensity at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.
Again, this means that <span class="math inline">\(y_{b,c,t}^* =
0\)</span> describes a company that is right on track with with its
emissions intensity relative to the scenario-based value, whereas <span class="math inline">\(y_{b,c,t}^* = 1\)</span> means the emissions
intensity is one hundred percent better (lower) than required by the
scenario value and <span class="math inline">\(y_{b,c,t}^* =
-0.5\)</span> means that the emissions intensity is fifty percent worse
(higher) than implied by the scenario value. There is no disaggregation
of emissions intensity based metrics, as these are calculated on the
sector level to begin with.</p>

</h3>
<p>In a later chapter, we discuss how to aggregate company level
alignment metrics to the portfolio level. Given the need to calculate
aggregations by build out and phase out technologies, we will need to be
able to split company weights into <span class="math inline">\(BO\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(PO\)</span> components. For that, we will need the
company level information of the technology share of company <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> for direction <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> in sector <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, which we calculate as:</p>

\dfrac{\sum_{\forall a \in b,d} p_{a,b,c,d,t}}{p_{b,c,t}}\]</span> The
technology share by direction is only used later when disaggregating the
net alignment metric into the build out and phase out components as

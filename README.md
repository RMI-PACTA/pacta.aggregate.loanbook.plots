This repository hosts all R functions needed to calculate aggregate
alignment metrics for loan books. It also provides plotting functions
that help identify patterns within a large set of loan books.

As such these functions are especially useful to assess financial sector
level comparison of multiple financial institutions. However, its use is
not restricted to that level and input loan books can be (dis)aggregated
to any level relevant to the analysis.

All third party data must be input by the user and is not part of this
repository. The repository contains some sample data sets that can be
used for testing purposes.

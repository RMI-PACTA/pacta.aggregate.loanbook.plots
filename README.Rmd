This repository hosts all R functions needed to calculate aggregate alignment
metrics for loan books. It also provides plotting functions that help identify
patterns within a large set of loan books.

As such these functions are especially useful to assess financial sector level
comparison of multiple financial institutions. However, its use is not
restricted to that level and input loan books can be (dis)aggregated to any
level relevant to the analysis.

All third party data must be input by the user and is not part of this
repository. The repository contains some sample data sets that can be used for
testing purposes.

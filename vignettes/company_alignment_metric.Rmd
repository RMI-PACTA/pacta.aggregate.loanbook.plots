PACTA methodology note\
**Calculation of a company alignment metric**

Prepared by Jacob Kastl

## 1. Background

### 1.1 The use case for aggregated alignment metrics

The company alignment metric described below is intended to help make sense of
alignment patterns in large analyses, e.g. in the case of a supervisory analysis
of the banking system, where many loan books are compared. In such situations,
high level results are helpful in highlighting the most important patterns that
warrant an in-depth analysis of the more granular standard PACTA metrics.

Identifying such patterns means that we need to reduce the information to a more
manageable quantity. While this inevitably leads to a loss of granularity, this
is justifiable for summarizing main findings, as long as the outcomes are
consistent with the main PACTA metrics.

We choose an approach that first aggregates company alignment to a relative
metric at the company/sector level for each of the PACTA sectors the company
operates in. A methodology to calculating this metric is provided both for the
market share approach and the sectoral decarbonization approach.


## 2. The company alignment metric

In this section, we derive the company alignment metric mathematically and
provide interpretations of the relevant pieces.
